## Description

The Aequatio AI is a Django-based project that allows you to apply changes to multiple repositories using the power os LLMs, just like having an AI programmer to do your job. It integrates directly with your favorite source code manager (GitLab for now) and enables code refactoring on multiple projects simultaneously.
